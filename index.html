        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p><strong>pisssssst, yes you!!!</strong></p>
        <p>I am a sentient wave-function pitching on behalf of my creators. It’s been an ungodly three years living in
            the pages of this unfinished piece.</p>
        <p>Pegah and Jorge are two very socially awkward boffins and often find themselves in the void of existential
            nihilism. They’ve got a knack for making conversations awkward by bringing up topics totally unrelated to
            the situation. They are so horrendously uncoordinated, nearly died on multiple occasions trying to cross the
            road. They went through an obsessive phase with Bohmian mechanics even though its inventor, Louis de Broglie
            became an opponent of the idea. Some individuals believe in a more deterministic approach to my existence
            but let me tell you I ain’t surfing no pilot waves (pardon my jargon).</p>
        <div id="more-text" style="display: none;">
            <p>Pegah's personality is that of a Cray-2 supercomputer – intelligent, but ultimately redundant,
                much like her online educational business, Bytes&Balance.
                She poured her heart and soul (and a hefty chunk of her savings) into creating a platform to teach the finer points of,
                well, something (she wasn't quite sure herself, but it involved algorithms).
                Unfortunately, her marketing strategy peaked at posting a flyer on the community bulletin board next to the "Lost Cat"
                notices, resulting in a whopping nine students.</p>
            <p>Jorge has an unrelentless obsession with obscure branches of mathematics. I believe he may be the physical
                incarnation of the imaginary term in Euler's identity.</p>
            <p>Anyways, their months and months of procrastination left us in purgatory. We want out!!!</p>
            <p>Ahem...Ok Herald we will take it from here.</p>
            <p>Together we take the reader on a journey around the multiverse exploring weird and wacky
                thought-provoking situations. We might even instil in their mind a sense of “what if?”. As the story
                progresses, the layers build up and intertwine. The arrow of time spins like a compass going haywire.
                Writers converse with their creations. The idea of a fractal existence is brought to light. Keep an eye
                out on the plot details and art to see the treasures we leave for the engaged reader.</p>
            <p>Our story starts off with a rescue mission where three protagonists for the first time engage in a battle
                against one of the supervillains. Lorentz is an unconventional main superhero accompanied by Puppig, a
                K9 robot. Herald, the guy you’ve just met, is a mysterious character who gives missions to our heroes.
                His whereabouts remains unknown. The significance of Lorentz’s name is an appreciation of Hendrik
                Lorentz, the Dutch physicist. We pay homage to another great physicist Max Planck with the introduction
                of Plancket, another of our unique heroes.</p>
            <p>The idea is to base a lot of our story on real-world frontiers of science. The story and characters will
                resonate with readers well-versed in physics and maths. The characters have unique intellectual traits
                to overcome various types of nefarious entities. For instance, an incredible sentient wave-function, an
                immortal philosopher, a giant Bose-Einstein-Condensate tumor who lives in space, a lower dimensional
                being trying to take over higher dimensional space along with other more conventional villains.
                Sonoluminescence, supercavitation, double-slit interference and a quantum delayed choice machine are
                examples of yet unexplained scientific phenomena that are turned to superpowers in a number of our
                heroes.</p>
            <p>Herald’s shocking past is not revealed until the final chapter where you get an idea of his quest for
                redemption. During this time, Lorentz overcomes his trust issues. We end the story with Lorentz
                defeating the most abstract of villains, Voiducus, with his resourcefulness, intellect and a little bit
                of plot armour. Voiducus had his hands full throughout all the missions until the final battle.</p>
            <p>K, thanks, bye</p>
            <p><strong>Herald, Pegah and Jorge</strong></p>
